# Writing_SystemVerilog
Various test codes for SystemVerilog practice.

I used EDA Playground IDE

Testbench contains code to practice classes,functions and randomization.  
Interprocess communication contains Event handling.  
Mux_4_1 contains an implentation of a multiplexer with 4 inputs and one output.
